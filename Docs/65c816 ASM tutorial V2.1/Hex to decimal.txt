Here is a little script that spel werdz rite wrote in C#, to 
generate hex and decimal numbers up to 0xFFFF/65535. It will output
the results in the C: drive in HTML <tr><td> format. It will also show how long the process took.

	string[] Lines = new string[0x10000];
	long a = DateTime.Now.Ticks;
	for (int i = 0; i < 0x10000; i++)
		Lines[i] = "<tr><td>0x" + i.ToString("X4") + "</td><td>" + i.ToString() + "</td></tr>";
	long b = DateTime.Now.Ticks;
	MessageBox.Show(((b - a) / 10000).ToString() + "ms");
	System.IO.File.WriteAllLines("C:\\Text.txt", Lines);

Put the output between a <table></table> tag. Additionally, you could add
a border attribute, and center the table too.
